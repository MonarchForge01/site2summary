## 🧩 What It Does

This Python-based tool scrapes any publicly accessible website and summarizes its main content using a locally running LLaMA 3 model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). It removes non-informative noise (ads, navigation, footers) and generates a human-readable markdown summary.

Great! Here's an updated **Highlights** section you can add to the top of your `README.md` to showcase the real-world capability of your tool with **summaries from three diverse websites**. This will give readers a clear and immediate understanding of the tool’s power.
